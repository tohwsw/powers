4. **Required AWS Permissions**: Your IAM user/role needs:
   - `cloudwatch:*` for CloudWatch Metrics and Alarms
   - `logs:*` for CloudWatch Logs operations (includes CloudTrail log querying)
   - `xray:*` for distributed tracing
   - `cloudtrail:*` for CloudTrail queries
   - `application-signals:*` for Application Signals
   - `synthetics:GetCanary`, `synthetics:GetCanaryRuns` for canary analysis
   - `s3:GetObject`, `s3:ListBucket` for canary artifacts
   - `iam:GetRole`, `iam:ListAttachedRolePolicies`, `iam:GetPolicy`, `iam:GetPolicyVersion` for the enablement guide

## Configuration

After installing this power, update the MCP server configuration with your AWS profile and region:

1. Open Kiro Settings → MCP Servers (or edit `~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json`)
2. Find the `awslabs.cloudwatch-mcp-server` entry
3. Update the `env` section:

```json
"env": {
  "AWS_PROFILE": "your-profile-name",  // ← Change to your AWS profile
  "AWS_REGION": "us-east-1",           // ← Change to your region
  "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR"
}
```

**Default:** Uses `default` AWS profile and `us-east-1` region.

## Quick Test

After configuration, try: *"Show me my CloudWatch log groups"*
